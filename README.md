# My DAOS tools
Here I have the scripts and tools I'm developing for my daily work.

- `vxml-tool` tool that parses Valgrind XML files in a directory and prints information about leaks. For more information use `vxml-tool -h`.

To use this tool, add this directory to `PATH` variable and create a symbolic link to the tools.
